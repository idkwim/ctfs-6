== Narrative [10 of 10]

Parts of the "Narrative" text appears as a progress of the
completed objectives.

After completing the whole game, it is 10 of 10. Here is the
full text:

....
Whose grounds these are, I think I know
His home is in the North Pole though
He will not mind me traipsing here
To watch his students learn and grow
Some other folk might stop and sneer
"Two turtle doves, this man did rear?"
I'll find the birds, come push or shove
Objectives given: I'll soon clear
Upon discov'ring each white dove,
The subject of much campus love,
I find the challenges are more
Than one can count on woolen glove.
Who wandered thus through closet door?
Ho ho, what's this? What strange boudoir!
Things here cannot be what they seem
That portal's more than clothing store.
Who enters contests by the ream
And lives in tunnels meant for steam?
This Krampus bloke seems rather strange
And yet I must now join his team...
Despite this fellow's funk and mange
My fate, I think, he's bound to change.
What is this contest all about?
His victory I shall arrange!
To arms, my friends! Do scream and shout!
Some villain targets Santa's route!
What scum - what filth would seek to end
Kris Kringle's journey while he's out?
Surprised, I am, but "shock" may tend
To overstate and condescend.
'Tis little more than plot reveal
That fairies often do extend
And yet, despite her jealous zeal,
My skills did win, my hacking heal!
No dental dealer can so keep
Our red-clad hero in ordeal!
This Christmas must now fall asleep,
But next year comes, and troubles creep.
And Jack Frost hasn't made a peep,
And Jack Frost hasn't made a peep...
....

== Objectives

=== 0) Talk to Santa in the Quad [[obj00]]

[.float-group]
--
image:obj00_talktosanta.png[,,200,role="related right"]

Task: Enter the campus quad and talk to Santa.

This is just an introduction "objective" without any hacking challenges.

Solution: Move out the avatar to the Quad and click Santa.
--

=== 1) Find the Turtle Doves [[obj01]]

[.float-group]
--
image:obj01_turtledoves.png[,,200,role="related left"]

Task: Find the missing turtle doves.

There is still no hacking challenge.

Solution: The missing turtle doves can be found in the Student Union
(north to the Quad).
--

=== 2) Unredact Threating Document [[obj02]]

[.float-group]
--
image:obj02_letter.png[,,200,role="related right"]

Task: Someone sent a threatening letter to Elf University. What is the
first word in ALL CAPS in the subject line of the letter? Please find
the letter in the Quad.

This is the first hacking challenge marked with difficulty 1/5.

Solution: The letter can be found in the NW corner of the Quad.

Here is the downloadable PDF:
https://downloads.elfu.org/LetterToElfUPersonnel.pdf[windows="_blank"]
--

Some parts of the letter is covered with a box making it
"Confidential".  However, the text is still there, below the box. It
can be extracted from the PDF, or much simpler, it can be selected
(and copy & pasted or some viewers, like evince show it).

.Text selected below covering box (using viewer evince)
[caption="Objective 2: "]
image::obj02_letter_uncovered.png[]

The answer is: "DEMAND".

=== 3) Windows Log Analysis: Evaluate Attack Outcome [[obj03]]

Task: We're seeing attacks against the Elf U domain! Using
https://downloads.elfu.org/Security.evtx.zip[the event log data,window="_blank"],
identify the user account that the attacker compromised
using a password spray attack. Bushy Evergreen is hanging out in the
train station and may be able to help you out.

Difficulty: 1/5

Solution: https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI[DeepBlueCLI,window="_blank"]
helps analyzing the Windows Event Log.
Using Windows PowerShell is mandatory.

Processing the evtx log and extracting suspicious information:

 .\DeepBlue.ps1 Security.evtx | ConvertTo-Html | Out-File security-deepblue.html

The resulting html is a human-readable summary of the intrusion events.

.DeepBlueCLI processed Security.evtx log
[caption="Objective 3: "]
image::obj03_deepblue.png[]

Note, that a lots of users has a large number (77) of logon failures,
while user "supatree" has 76 logon failures and 2 successful logon events.
This is a typical password spraying attack, resulting "supatree" as
a compromised user.

The answer is "supatree".

=== 4) Windows Log Analysis: Determine Attacker Technique [[obj04]]

Task: Using
https://downloads.elfu.org/sysmon-data.json.zip[these normalized Sysmon logs],
identify the tool the attacker used to
retrieve domain password hashes from the lsass.exe process. For hints
on achieving this objective, please visit Hermey Hall and talk with
SugarPlum Mary.

Difficulty: 2/5

Solution: Use the https://eql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Event Query Language]
for the normalized (JSON) Sysmon logs.

The normalized Sysmon log contains mostly `process` type events,
those should be the most interesting for us. Let us filter the
processes whose parent process is `cmd.exe`. These are a lot,
let us exclude the uninteresting `net.exe` commands:

 eql query -f ./sysmon-data.json "process where event_type = 'process' and parent_process_name = 'cmd.exe' and process_name != 'net.exe'" | jq

The results are two PowerShell commands and this:

image::obj04_eql.png[]

This last one is about creating a backup of the ntds database
containing the domain password hashes using the `ntdsutil.exe`
Windows AD command line tool.

So the answer is "ntdsutil.exe".

=== 5) Network Log Analysis: Determine Compromised System [[obj05]]

Task: The attacks don't stop! Can you help identify the IP address of
the malware-infected system using these
https://downloads.elfu.org/elfu-zeeklogs.zip[Zeek logs]? For hints on
achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory and talk with
Sparkle Redberry.

Difficulty: 2/5

Solution: The Zeek logs contain
https://github.com/activecm/rita[Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) framework]
HTML files in the ELFU folder.

Observing the "Long Connections" reveals a suspiciously long connection
from 192.168.134.130 to 148.69.64.76:443. So 192.168.134.130 should be
the infected system in the LAN. Furthermore, the suspiciously high
number of beacons originating the same 192.168.134.130 IP is also
confirming this.

.RITA showing the Long Connections
[caption="Objective 5: "]
image::obj05_rita_long.png[]

.The same source has suspiciously high number of beacons
[caption="Objective 5: "]
image::obj05_rita_beacons.png[]

The answer is "192.168.134.130".

=== 6) Splunk [[obj06]]

Task: Access https://splunk.elfu.org/ as elf with password
elfsocks. What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in
this attack? The SOC folks at that link will help you along! For hints
on achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory in Hermey
Hall and talk with Prof. Banas.

Difficulty: 3/5

Solution: This challenge is about performing searches in a dedicated
Splunk SOC. Instructions can be found in the chat. There is a search
engine and a file archive for answering the questions.

Training questions:

1.) What is the short host name of Professor Banas' computer?

It is `sweetums`. (Every log entry is from the ComputerName sweetums.elfu.org)

2.) What is the name of the sensitive file that was likely accessed and
copied by the attacker? Please provide the fully qualified location of
the file. (Example: C:\temp\report.pdf)

It is `C:\Users\cbanas\Documents\Naughty_and_Nice_2019_draft.txt`
(Just search for "index=main cbanas Users").

3.) What is the fully-qualified domain name(FQDN) of the command and
control(C2) server? (Example: badguy.baddies.com)

Use the recommended search

 index=main sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational powershell EventCode=3

and select `DestinationHostname` from the "Interesting Fields" list.

It is `144.202.46.214.vultr.com`.

4.) What document is involved with launching the malicious PowerShell
code? Please provide just the filename. (Example: results.txt)

Find the starting of PowerShell activity (according to the hint):

 index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational" | reverse

Pivot on time window (+-5 sec): process just before the first PowerShell
activity is WINWORD.exe with ProcessId=6268. Clear the time window
and search for ProcessId=6268. Nothing useful. NP, try it with
Windows Process Execution events instead of Sysmon, but here the
ProcessId is in hexadecimal (6268=0x187c):

 index=main EventCode=4688 0x187c

Only 2 events, one of them is the WINWORD.EXE launch with the malicious
document in the Process Command Line:
`19th Century Holiday Cheer Assignment.docm`

.Opening the malicious docm file with WINWORD.EXE
[caption="Objective 6: "]
image::obj06_splunk_00.png[]

5.) How many unique email addresses were used to send Holiday Cheer
essays to Professor Banas? Please provide the numeric value. (Example:
1)

Just follow the directions in the chat and modify the query:

 index=main sourcetype=stoq AND results{}.workers.smtp.subject="Holiday Cheer Assignment Submission" | table _time results{}.workers.smtp.to results{}.workers.smtp.from results{}.workers.smtp.subject results{}.workers.smtp.body | sort - _time

The answer is 21.

6.) What was the password for the zip archive that contained the
suspicious file?

The file came as an email attachment. It is in the previous list. Just
narrow down the search by the filename found above:

 index=main sourcetype=stoq AND results{}.workers.smtp.subject="Holiday Cheer Assignment Submission" AND 19th | table _time results{}.workers.smtp.to results{}.workers.smtp.from results{}.workers.smtp.subject results{}.workers.smtp.body | sort - _time

.Found the email containing the malicious content
[caption="Objective 6: "]
image::obj06_splunk_01.png[]

The zip password is "123456789".

7.) What email address did the suspicious file come from?

The answer is also available from the previous search (smtp.from field
in the table): "bradly.buttercups@eifu.org".

Now go for the Challenge Question:

FINAL) What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in
this attack?

Following the advices from the chat the malicious file parts
URLs will be available.

.Chat in the Elf University SOC
[caption="Objective 6: "]
image::obj06_splunk_02.png[]

.Splunk query for extracting the docm xml paths
[caption="Objective 6: "]
image::obj06_splunk_03.png[]

Now the required files can be downloaded from the
https://elfu-soc.s3.amazonaws.com/ server.

The `core.xml` contains the "description" metadata available here:

https://elfu-soc.s3.amazonaws.com/stoQ%20Artifacts/home/ubuntu/archive/f/f/1/e/a/ff1ea6f13be3faabd0da728f514deb7fe3577cc4

The message in the description is: "Kent you are so unfair. And we
were going to make you the king of the Winter Carnival.". This is the
answer to the challenge question.


=== 7) Get Access To The Steam Tunnels [[obj07]]

Task: Gain access to the steam tunnels. Who took the turtle doves?
Please tell us their first and last name. For hints on achieving this
objective, please visit Minty's dorm room and talk with Minty Candy
Cane.

Difficulty: 3/5

Solution: Access to The Steam Tunnels enables some "teleportation" ability.

.The Steam Tunnel Map
[caption="Objective 7: "]
image::obj07_steam.png[]

=== 8) Bypassing the Frido Sleigh CAPTEHA [[obj08]]

Task: Help Krampus beat the
https://fridosleigh.com/[Frido Sleigh contest]. For hints on
achieving this objective, please talk with Alabaster Snowball in the
Speaker Unpreparedness Room.

Difficulty: 4/5

In order to win the contest, we need to submit a form as many times as
possible within a minute. The problem is that it is protected by a
reverse captcha (so-called CAPTEHA: Completely Automated Public Turing
test to tell Elves and Humans Apart).

It cannot be validated by a human, because you have to classify
100 images into 5 categories in 5 seconds. It can be solved only
by a computer.

Solution: We should build an ML Model to solve the CAPTEHA. The great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmVPLwjm_zs[KringleCon talk of Chris Davis about Machine Learning Use Cases for Cybersecurity]
really helps solving this challenge.

Steps needed to solve this:

. Get the CAPTEHA images (and categories)
. Manually classify some images into categories
. Train the ML Model using the manually classified images and a lot more downloaded data set
. Use the trained model to solve the CAPTEHA (and submit the form as many times as we can ;) )

Python script for getting the CAPTEHA images (and labels):

.getimages.py
[source,python]
----
include::{sourcedir}/capteha/getimages.py[]
----

Helper script for manual classification (using the great
https://feh.finalrewind.org/[feh] image viewer):

.pretrain.sh
[source,bash]
----
include::{sourcedir}/capteha/pretrain.sh[]
----

Manual training is enough if all of the categories have ~20 images.

Machine learning can be performed by the open-source
https://www.tensorflow.org[TensorFlow] platform.

The
https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo[image recognition demo by Chris]
needs only slight modifications to use in this situation. However,
installing TensorFlow in a Python virtual env is highly recommended.

Use the `retrain.py` script from the demo to train the model.

Once ready (couple of minutes), predicting new images should work
reliably and relatively fast (used a ProLiant DL380e Gen8 with
dual 6-core E5-2420 Xeon ;) ).

The `predict_images_using_trained_model.py` script can be modified
and updated to work with the Frido Sleigh CAPTEHA and form submission:

.capteha.py
[source,python]
----
include::{sourcedir}/capteha/capteha.py[]
----

After a lot of quick submissions the Frido Sleigh system replies
with a winner message, and the winning code should land by email.

.The winning message
[caption="Objective 8: "]
image::obj08_capteha_win.png[]

The code is "8Ia8LiZEwvyZr2WO".

=== 9) Retrieve Scarps of Paper from Server

Task: Gain access to the data on the
https://studentportal.elfu.org/[Student Portal] server and
retrieve the paper scraps hosted there. What is the name of Santa's
cutting-edge sleigh guidance system? For hints on achieving this
objective, please visit the dorm and talk with Pepper Minstix.

Solution: One can quickly detect that the application-check.php
script has SQL injection vulnerability in the elfmail parameter.

.SQL injection detected
[caption="Objective 9: "]
image:obj09_sqli_detect.png[]

It could be exploited by boolean-blind based technique, but there
is a (weak) protection which makes our life a little bit harder.

The email checking process is the following:

. Pressing the "Check Status" button on the check.php page 1st calls
validator.php which returns a token
. Then the check.php page calls the application-check.php with the
email address, but the token is also included in the request
If the token is wrong, the check does not performed.

.Token validation process
[caption="Objective 9: "]
image::obj09_sqli_token.png[]

This is an example token:

MTAwOTU4NDE4MTEyMTU3NzQ3NTI4MzEwMDk1ODQxOC4xMTI=_MTI5MjI2Nzc1MTgzMzYzMjMwNjY5Mzc5LjU4NA==

It is built from two parts separated by `_`, the 1st and 2nd part
is also a base64 encoded number. Decoding the parts:

* 1009584181121577475283100958418.112
* 129226775183363230669379.584

Although these numbers seem to be predictable (seems to be increasing
almost linearly by time), but let us take a much simpler approach:

* implement the validator.php call in the SQL injection exploit process.

This can be achieved easily using the famous
http://sqlmap.org/[sqlmap] tool by https://twitter.com/stamparm[@stamparm].

We just need to add a custom tamper script (in /sqlmap/tamper folder):

.sans2019.py
[source,python]
----
include::{sourcedir}/sqli/sans2019.py[]
----

And do not forget to skip urlencode of the "payload" (we added
urlencode for just the actual payload in the parameter in the
tamper script, this "payload" is the real payload appended with
the & separator and the token).

Furthermore, the below used `email@email.com` should be added to
the database (by the "Apply Now" function to make the blind attack work).

 sqlmap -u https://studentportal.elfu.org/application-check.php?elfmail=email@email.com --technique B --tamper sans2019 --skip-urlencode -D elfu --threads 10 -T krampus --dump

.Dumping the SQL banner using sqlmap
[caption="Objective 9: "]
image::obj09_sqli_banner.png[]

The dumped `krampus` table contains the paper scraps hidden paths:

* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/0f5f510e.png
* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/1cc7e121.png
* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/439f15e6.png
* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/667d6896.png
* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/adb798ca.png
* https://studentportal.elfu.org/krampus/ba417715.png

(The prefix https://studentportal.elfu.org was added.)

Fortunately these scraps can be fit together
(e.g. using https://www.gimp.org/[GIMP]).

.Paper Scraps fit together
[caption="Objective 9: "]
image::obj09_sqli_recovered.png[]

Reading the recovered message reveals the name of the guidance system:
"Super Sled-o-matic".


=== 10) Recover Cleartext Document [[obj10]]

Task: The https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.exe[Elfscrow Crypto]
tool is a vital asset used at Elf University
for encrypting SUPER SECRET documents. We can't send you the source,
but we do have
https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.pdb[debug symbols]
that you can use.

Recover the plaintext content for this
https://downloads.elfu.org/ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc[encrypted document].
We know that it was encrypted on December 6, 2019, between 7pm and 9pm UTC.

What is the middle line on the cover page? (Hint: it's five words)

For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the NetWars room
and talk with Holly Evergreen.

Difficulty: 5/5

Solution: Let us summarize what we have.

* elfscrow.exe crypto tool: it can encrypt / decrypt files

.Help of elfscrow.exe
[caption="Objective 10: "]
image::obj10_elfscrow.png[]

* elfscrow.pdb: debug symbols for elfscrow.exe

* ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc: encrypted message
(encrypted on December 6, 2019, between 7pm and 9pm UTC.)

First, let us try to understand what does the elfscrow.exe binary do. This is a typical
reverse engineering work, let us use the NSA tool https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].

In order to use the debug symbols included in the pdb file, using Windows is recommended.
The README_PDB.html file in the docs folder contains information about the needed dlls.

Without any assistance, Ghidra can decompile the whole binary to human-readable
and understandable C code.

.Decompiling elfscrow.exe to C code using Ghidra
[caption="Objective 10: "]
image::obj10_ghidra.png[]

The encrpy/decrypt algorithm used is a simple (symmetric) DES algorithm.
In encryption, the key is generated randomly, it gets saved to a remote server,
the server returns a pass after successful save. The pass can be used to pull
the key and decrypt the message.

The problem with this process is that random number generator gets initialized
by a predictable value, the system time. Therefore the whole key generation is
predictable, because it depends only on the system time (when the key was created).

So we do not have to deal with server side key storage. If we know when was
the document encrypted (approximately), we can iterate the seed (the exact
time rounded to seconds), generate the keys, do the decryption. The decryption
should be successful if we match the exact key generation time of the encryption
(in seconds).

The brute force decrypter implemented for this situation (using the results
of reversing the key generator from elfscrow.exe):

.decrypt-bf.py
[source,python]
----
include::{sourcedir}/crypto/decrypt-bf.py[]
----

The brute forcing process is very fast, should finish in <3 mins:

.Brute forcing the key
[caption="Objective 10: "]

After successful finish, the `ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf`
is available as cleartext document.

.Recovered Cleartext Document (cover page)

image::obj10_cleartext.png[]

The answer to the objective question is "Machine Learning Sleigh Router Finder".


=== 11) Open the Sleigh Shop Door [[obj11]]

Task: Visit Shinny Upatree in the Student Union and help solve their
problem. What is written on the paper you retrieve for Shinny?

For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Student Union
and talk with Kent Tinseltooth.

Difficulty: 5/5

Solution: With the hints, it is almost straightforward.

. view JavaScript console, code is on the console
. go to Print Preview, code is there
. view Network Requests, preview of a pic is the code
. view Local Storage
. view Title (far right)
. Inspect Element, modify CSS
. Inspect Element, view Font-Family attribute in CSS
. Inspect Element, view Event Listener
. Inspect Element, force elements state to active
. Inspect Element, move "cover" div, view code on board, view errors on js console,

Completing the challenge reveals the villian: "The Tooth Fairy"
(what is also the password as it is shown on the js console).

image::obj11_complete.png[]

=== 12) Filter Out Poisoned Sources of Weather Data [[obj12]]

Task: Use the data supplied in the
https://downloads.elfu.org/http.log.gz[Zeek JSON logs] to identify the IP
addresses of attackers poisoning Santa's flight mapping
software.
https://srf.elfu.org/[Block the 100 offending sources of information to guide Santa's sleigh]
through the attack. Submit the Route ID ("RID") success
value that you're given. For hints on achieving this objective, please
visit the Sleigh Shop and talk with Wunorse Openslae.

Difficulty: 4/5

Solution: This challenge is about extracting information from Zeek JSON data by the
`jq` command-line JSON processor.

First we should able to login to the https://srf.elfu.org[Sleigh Route Finder API].

In the Cleartext PDF from <<obj10,Objective 10>> we can read:
"The default login credentials should be changed on startup and can be found in the readme in the ElfU Research Labs git repository."

Okay, let us search for some readme in the http.log URLs:

 cat http.log | jq '.[].uri' | grep -i readme

The result is https://srf.elfu.org/README.md, where we can find the default admin login credentials
`admin:924158F9522B3744F5FCD4D10FAC4356` which is working. ;)

.Logged in as admin on the Sleigh Route Finder API
[caption="Objective 12: "]
image::obj12_api.png[]

Next task is to find as many malicious IPs as we can.

Malicious IPs could be detected by patterns of the most common attacks like LFI, XSS, SQLi, RCE.

Pattern for LFI is `../` or `.|./`, for XSS it may be `<script`, for RCE by ShellShock it may be `() {`,
for SQLi it may be `' `, and a general suspicious stuff should be '/etc/'. These patterns may be found in
the URL, User-Agent string, Username, or Host also.

So this query collects malicious IPs matching the above patterns:

 cat http.log | jq '.[] | select([.uri, .user_agent, .username, .host] | add | match("\\.[\\|]?\\./|<script|() {|'\'' |/etc/")) | {ip: .["id.orig_h"], user_agent: .user_agent}'

The results contain {ip, user_agent} pairs.

But what if the attacker uses proxies (which means the IP address is not static)? Assuming the user_agent is the same,
it is possible to block the other IPs connected to the same attacker by matching the user_agent.

So the theory is:

. filter IP addresses by the above pattern matching jq selection (also collect the user_agent strings as well)
. search the log for the "malicious" user_agents and mark their IPs as malicious also (but only if the user_agent
is somewhat unique and not a generic one, which means e.g. the number of similar user_agents is less then e.g. 8 in the
log)

Implementation:

.filter_ip.sh
[source,]
----
include::{sourcedir}/jq/filter_ip.sh[]
----

The result of this filtering is 98 IPs. Unfortunately it is not 100 (which was given in the challenge
description), but it was enough, uploading it as a blocklist solved the final challenge.

.Route calculation success!

using PowerShell commandline and set the laser using the API.

.PowerShell terminal for interacting with Laser API
[caption="Xmas Laser Project: "]
image::laser_00.png[]

Solution: Invoking a simple GET request to the API interface
shows some help:

 (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:1225/).RawContent

The help describes the API and lists the needed parameters.
We need to find the correct parameters.

The `callingcard.txt` file mentions "history".

 type /home/callingcard.txt

The `history` command shows the commandline history including this:

 (Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/angle?val=65.5).RawContent
  
This hints that the angle paramater should be "65.5". Furthermore,
there is a message about "name=value" parameters.

After looking around with `dir`, we can see that there is a large
(very large) directory tree with tons of short random named files
in the folder "depth".

Searching for "=" in these files (using the "name=value" hint) by

 Get-ChildItem depths -Recurse -File | Select-String -Pattern "=" | Select-Object -Unique Path

returns `/home/elf/depths/produce/thhy5hll.txt`. This contains
another parameter `temperature?=-33.5` and a next hint about
sorting the files by length.

 Get-ChildItem depths -Recurse -File | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object -First 2 FullName | ForEach-Object { type $_.FullName }

This way we typed the next longest message (the longest one was the
message containing the parameter above) which contains another hint.

We should stop processes by a specific order matching usernames.

Listing the processes by `Get-Process -IncludeUserName` and killing
them by `kill` in the specified order reveals a new file what
can be typed by `type /shall/see`.

.Finding the correct parameters

Now we should get an Event Log `.xml` file in `/etc` and group the
`.Id`'s and select the Properties of the lonely unique event Id.

Searching for the `.xml` file, processing it as xml and getting the
required info:

 Get-ChildItem /etc -Include "*.xml" -Recurse -File
 [xml]$x = Get-Content /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/EventLog.xml
 ($x.Objs.Obj.Props | Where { $_.I32.N -Eq "Id" }) | Where { $_.I32.'#text' -Eq 1 } | Select-Object *

The result contains the gases postbody parameters:

 $correct_gases_postbody = @{O=6;H=7;He=3;N=4;Ne=22;Ar=11;Xe=10;F=20;Kr=8;Rn=9}

The last parameter is in the environment variables. Typing `$env:` in
the commandline and pressing `[TAB]` lists the environment
variables. There is a special one called "riddle", `$env:riddle`
displays its contents.

It is about sorting `/etc` by LastWriteTime and mentioning the newest one.

 Get-ChildItem /etc -File -Recurse | Sort-Object LastWriteTime

The newest file is `/etc/apt/archive`. It is a zipfile, let us
extract it. We may use the .NET Framework Assembly
`System.IO.Compression.FileSystem` for extracting:

 [Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('System.IO.Compression.FileSystem')
 [IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("/etc/apt/archive", "/tmp")

There are two extracted files in the folder called refraction:

* riddle
* runme.elf

Running the `runme.elf` shows the `refraction?val=1.867` missing parameter
of the laser (do not forget to `chmod +x` the binary).

And the riddle refers to an md5 hash in the elf home depths folder.

Calculating all of the md5 hashes in depth and matching with this by

 gci /home/elf/depths -File -Recurse | Get-FileHash -Algorithm md5 | Where-Object { $_.Hash -Eq "25520151A320B5B0D21561F92C8F6224" } | Select Path

leads us to the `/home/elf/depths/produce/thhy5hll.txt` file we have
found already in the beginning with a heuristic method.

All of the parameters are collected, it is time to set the laser:

 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/on
 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/angle?val=65.5
 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/temperature?val=-33.5
 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/refraction?val=1.867
 $gas = @{O=6;H=7;He=3;N=4;Ne=22;Ar=11;Xe=10;F=20;Kr=8;Rn=9}
 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/gas -method POST -body $gas
 iwr http://127.0.0.1:1225/api/output

.Finally, solved!

=== Frosty Keypad

[.float-group]
--
image:keypad.png[,,180,role="related right"]

The Frosty Keypad is located in the East side of The Quad,
it is unlocking the door to the Dormitory.

The keys 1, 3, 7 and Enter seem metled while the others
are frozen. This reveals that the combination should contain
only the digits 1, 3 and 7.

The unlocking HTTP request to the keypad is a GET request to

 https://keypad.elfu.org/checkpass.php?i=1234&resourceId=

where `i` is the digit combination (actually permutation) and
the `resourceId` is the player's id.

Supposing a 4-digit code, brute forcing is trivial by
https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz[wfuzz]:

 wfuzz -u 'https://keypad.elfu.org/checkpass.php?i=FUZZ&resourceId=34axxxxx-81xx-46xx-bexx-7594xxxxxxxx' -z permutation,137-4 --hs=Invalid

=== Holiday Hack Trail

Task: Win the game (travel to the end of the trail).

Solution: Game state parameters are stored on the client side
and the client sends the parameters to the server in every turn.

The server trusts the client and accepts everything the client sends
without validation. In "Hard" difficulty there is a verifier hash, but
it is also calculated on the client side.

As a consequence, the long trail can be "bypassed" on the 1st turn
by a properly modified request and we can jump to the end of trail
and win the game immediately.

.A modified request in hard difficulty (with recalculated hash)

Note, that the hash is md5(sum of various integer parameters).

After submitting the edited request, winning is automatic.
