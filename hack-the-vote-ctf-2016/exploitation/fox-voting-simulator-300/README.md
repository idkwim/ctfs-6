**Description:**

> In primaries, it is important to get the most attention. With 12 candidates all sharing the stage, it can be hard to pull in voters. Luckily Mr Trump doesn't have much problem with that, but we have a strategy to secure the vote for good. We have found voters respond very well to name recognition, and which ever candidate is polling the highest. We see a snowball effect if we can tip a few online polls his way, then it will be easier for him to take the real ones, and then eventually the nomination.

> We were able to dump some of the source code from FOX's new online poll service. We couldn't get everything, but I'm sure that is no problem for you.

contains the C source of the FOX Voting Simulator service
listening at fox.pwn.republican:9000. Observing the source it can be
seen that a small part of it is missing: `NWO_memberVote` function
(probably) defined in the missing `nwo.h` header.

Connecting to the service a name (as a voter) can be defined,
it'll be "added to the record" / matched (if it was added previously)
/ denied (if it refers to a "candidate").
